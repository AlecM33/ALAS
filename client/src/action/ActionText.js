    description_title: "Why get an IEP?",
    description: <p>Now that your child has diagnosis of Autism, you child can benefit from special education services. To get things started, you need to contact the Special Education Department in your school district. There are two steps to getting your child enrolled in special education. The first is an evaluation. The schools call this an ETR. The second is a plan. The schools call this an IEP. The school will want a copy of the diagnostic report you got from your doctor. Sharing the information your already have may shorten the process.<br/><br/>
        You may be thinking my child already goes to school. It is important to get the ETR and IEP, even if you already have one it should be updated. <br/><br/>
        So, if your child is already going to public school, you can ask your teacher or principal for help. If your child attends a day care program or is in a private school setting, the staff will tell you to contact someone in the Special Education department in your public school district.</p>,
